UserScripts Readme
==================

Originally the configuration for hyprland was inspired by three different repositories, which we then took what we liked and went our own direction on the rest, these repositories were:

1. all
2. BufferPin
3. CarbonNow

This folder is for scripts added by the user that are not intended to be used for any form of distrobution or public release.
For compatibility it came from [abeer555 Hyprland-Dots](https://github.com/abeer555/Hyprland-Dots), although not all scripts
were included in this repository. So, if you want extra functionality or see something you like, you can use the
[Github Repo Directory Downloader](https://download-directory.github.io/) to download them from either the
[userscripts folder](https://github.com/abeer555/Hyprland-Dots/tree/master/hypr/UserScripts) or the
[scripts folder](https://github.com/abeer555/Hyprland-Dots/tree/master/hypr/scripts) both contain scripts that were
not included in this release.
